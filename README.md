## Description
The scripted effect behind this framework serves as a way for modders (namely myself, but all are welcome) to quickly convert a country's Devout interest group into that of any target religion, except Atheism.
### What it does
 - If the target country is Atheist, it will enact Freedom of Conscience
 - Changes the state religion
 - Changes the name of the IG to an default name for the target religion (ie. Evangelical Church for a Protestant target religion)
 - Adjusts the ideologies and traits of the IG to match the defaults of the target religion
 - Retires the current leader of the IG, allowing the game to auto-generate a new one with the correct religion
 - Converts 1% of the population in every owned state to the target religion, to allow assimilation to start
## How to use it
